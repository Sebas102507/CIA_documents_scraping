# CIA Declassified files project!

Hi! I'm Juan Sebastian Vargas Torres and here is a personal project I made in order to practice my skills on web scraping, this project is based on getting the declassfied documents of the CIA using Scrapy framework in python, then exporting the data in .json to Zyte and finally using a simple html interface in order to show the data.
